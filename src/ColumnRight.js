      <p><em>I exhort therefore,
      that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
      For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
      in all godliness and honesty.  For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
      Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</em></p>
