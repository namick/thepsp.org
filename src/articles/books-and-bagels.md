### Books and Bagels

What could be better than free coffee, bagels, and Christian books? Six times during the upcoming session, Public Servantsâ€™ Prayer will organize this event. Elected officials and their staff are bright people who enjoy reading books. Giving away Christ-centered books is an opportunity to change lives. If you or your church would like to sponsor this event by purchasing coffee and bagels, please contact me.
