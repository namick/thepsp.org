### Statehouse Prayer Service

One of the largest gatherings each year in Indianaâ€™s capitol is this prayer service. Around 800 people come together to start the session by petitioning God for wisdom and grace. In the past, the Governor, House Speaker, Senate Majority Leader, and many others have prayed publicly. If you have never been able to attend this special event, please attend this year. The date is January 3, 2018 from 12 noon - 1 p.m. We hope to see you there!
