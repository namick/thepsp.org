### Women’s Statehouse Day

Each year women from all over our state participate in this special day. Pam Russell leads these ladies in a time of refreshment, restoration, and rededication. Please read Pam’s article above closely. If ladies from your church have not participated in the past, please forward this newsletter to the appropriate leadership in your congregation. We would love for the women of your church to rally around our female public servants through prayer on February 28, 2018.
