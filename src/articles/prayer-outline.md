###My Prayer for Public Servants

Heavenly Father, please bless our leaders, and remind them that:

When they are lonely, You are a Friend that sticks closer than a brother.

When they have a problem or difficulty, You are the Giver of wisdom.

When they are wounded in heart, You are the Balm in Gilead.

When they are physically ill, You are the Great Physician.

When they are discouraged, You can give them hope.

When they are tempted and tried, You provide a way of escape.

When the weight of the office is more than they can bear, You are the burden bearer.

When the demands surround them, You can give sufficient grace and strength.

Father, please provide rest for their body, relief for their soul, and refreshment for their spirit.

Amen
