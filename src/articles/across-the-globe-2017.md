### World Wide Prayer Warriors

Recently our team traveled to Israel for a global conference with those who lead similar ministries for public officials. Words cannot express how excited we were to see God raising up ministry leaders all over the world. God has a heart for the souls of those in political power. Seeing God move in similar ways around the world was a confirmation of the vision Public Servants’ Prayer has adopted. God is doing a great work around the globe!

Matt was also honored with a request to join the “Jerusalem Prayer Breakfast” Board. This organization held their first prayer summit in 2017. Our hope is that this event will grow to become a global gathering of Christians. Please pray for guidance from God as well as exponential growth in this new partnership.
